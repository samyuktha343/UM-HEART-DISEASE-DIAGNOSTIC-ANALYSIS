About the Project:

I analyzed the dataset consisting of age,sex,heartrate,BP,Chlorestral of people to analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation and to find key metrics and factors and to show the meaningful relationships between attributes.

I done the Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing of the dataset with the help of Power Query to maintain the integrity and context of data and implemented data aggregation using Pivot Tables and charts in Excel.Interpreted my analytical skills through SQL and derived the meaningful insights.Visualized the insights of Heart Disease using dynamic dashboards using PowerBI.

The result I achieved shows the meaningful insights that above 60 years old people have 91% of getting heart disease and 66% of males have hear disease diagnosed analyzed over the factors such as
Coronary Arteries(Vessels of heart been affected),Types of Chest Pain,Thalassemia(Blood Disorder),Thalach(Maximum Heart Rate Achieved),Exang(Chest pain during physical activities).
 
 Through this project I learned about the importance of using Excel,SQL,Power BI and usage of the dynamic dashboards for interactive reports which deepened my descriptive analytical skills,insights derivations and statistical skills that is key to my Data Analyst Career.
